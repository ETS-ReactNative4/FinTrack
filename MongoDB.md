# MongoDB

## Plan

Use a cloud hosted database by MongoDB 

## Set Up
MongoDB needs an account to be set up from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/) before accessing to the database features.

My take is local host will be good for playing around with the mongodb, testing out the commands and interation.
Cloud host will be suitable for the actual mock data that we will use for testing with the app itself.
I'm not sure about the data limits on the cloud hosting platform, I think its around 500+ MB so I think its sufficient for our mock data. 

2 options with MongoDB
- MongoDB Community
    - Local Hosted DataBase on Local Machine
- MongoDB Atlas
    - Cloud Hosted DataBase on cloud services by third party services of our choice (AWS, GOOGLE, AZURE)

## MongoDB Community [Local Host]
Install MongoDB Community. `mongod` runs the database server locally. `mongo` runs the cli for MongoDB to interact with the database.

Run `mongod` first on one terminal / cmd to start the database server.

Run `mongo` on the another terminal to run cli to talk to the database being run from `mongod`.


## MongoDB Atlas [Cloud]
I will update this later when I catch up on the guide
