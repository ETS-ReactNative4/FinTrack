>Dear Sir:
>
>I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The >Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara >region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is >desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, >it is unable to move these funds to another region.
>
>You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central >Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States >account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your >accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of >this amount.
>
>However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at >least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
>
>If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, >and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with >certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
>
>Please call me at your earliest convenience at 12-345-678. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian >Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository >taxes on it.
>
>Yours truly,
>
>Prince Alyusi Islassis
