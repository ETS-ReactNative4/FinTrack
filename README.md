# FinTrack by Team NigerianPrince

## Overview
Proposed level of achievement: Apollo 11

This is a stock portfolio tracker that helps users to conveniently track their financial assets and dividend yield, personalised to include various miscellaneous fees independent of stock value.
Users will be able to create accounts and fill in their respective data.

The app will display graphs to visualise user portfolios and track dividends.

## Motivation
Keeping track of your stock portfolio can be tiresome and inconvenient especially when your portfolio gets too big which may result in information overload!This app, like many other stock portfolio apps out in the market, aims to be a convenient stop for users to collate their data in a single app. 

What differentiates us from other apps is that we track dividends on top of stock value, provide data visualisation, and account for brokerage and other miscellaneous fees. This is tailored to provide a more personalised and reliable portfolio tracker for users.

>Dear Sir:
>
>I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.
>
>You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount.
>
>However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
>
>If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
>
>Please call me at your earliest convenience at 12-345-678. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it.
>
>Yours truly,
>
>Prince Alyusi Islassis
